I can't wait to see the resumes you put together!

The <head> of a website generally links to important resources the page will
need to load. You'll see a lot of <link>s to CSS files for styles and
<scripts> for JavaScript files to build interactions.

    jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
    Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
    about what is actually visible on a website.

    While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
    DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
    its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
    object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
    website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
    the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
    you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.

    Everything from here to the <script> tag below is the skeleton of your

    display by looking at the id or at what's written between the <h2> tags.
